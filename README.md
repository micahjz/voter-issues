# voter-issues
An iOS app that let's you create your own "know the candidates" style meme. Take a picture or upload one into the template, choose the issue, and write the descriptions. Maybe even keep Hillary and Bernie in the meme!

Of course, the save button takes screen shots without the buttons in the way!
